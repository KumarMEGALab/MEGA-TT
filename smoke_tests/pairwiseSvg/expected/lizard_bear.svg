In the study, the coding sequence of the silver fox MC1R gene was obtained by the method of PCR direct sequencing and aligning, the length was 954 bp. A total of 119 MC1R gene sequences with the complete Coding regions (CDS) belonging to 23 species were analyzed and the differentiation within and among the species was also studied. The results showed that most of the species have the stop codon TGA. Only Gallus gallus and Cereopsis novaehollandiae of Phasianidae and Danio rerio, respectively used TAG and TAA as the stop codon. The length of the MC1R gene with the complete CDS varies greatly, from 924-972 bp but most of the species had 954 bp. Observed genetic diversity was higher among species than within species and Canis lupus familiaris had more polymorphisms than any other species. Differentiation of the MC1R gene was obvious among species and the reconstructed phylogenetic tree was basically consistent with the taxonomy in the National Center for Biotechnology Information." author="Liu" cit-number="4628" pubmed-id="0" ref-id="Liu2012a" time="174.08" year="2012" title="Bioinformatics Analysis of Melanocortin-1 Receptor Gene for Silver Fox and Other Species" />
<circle cx="46" cy="438" r="6" fill="url(#dotsGradient)" abstract="Integration of fungal evolution with the dates of plate tectonic movements, paleoecology, and the evolution of plants and animals requires a molecularclock. Imperfect though they may be, molecularclocks provide the means to convert molecular change into geological time. The relationships among clocks, phylogeography, fossils, and substitution rate variation, along with incorporation of uncertainty into clock estimates are the topics for this commentary. This commentary is timely because, for deeper divergences on the order of hundreds of millions of years, estimates of age of origin are benefiting from increasingly accurate organismal phylogenies and increasingly realistic models of molecular evolution. Taking advantage of Bayesian approaches permitting complex assumptions about node ages and molecular evolution, we used the program BEAST to apply a relaxed lognormal clock analysis to a data set comprising 50 loci for 26 taxa. In the resulting tree, branches associated with nodes calibrated by fossils showed more dramatic substitution rate variation than branches at nodes lacking calibration. As a logical extension of this result, we suspect that undetected rate variation in the uncalibrated parts of the tree is as dramatic as in the calibrated sections, underscoring the importance of fossil calibration. Fortunately, new and interesting fungal fossils are being discovered and we review some of the new discoveries that confirm the ancient origin of important taxa. To help evaluate which fossils might be useful for constraining the ages of nodes, we selected fossils thought to be early members of their clades and used ribosomal or protein-coding gene sequence substitution rates to calculate whether fossil age and expected lineage age coincide. Where ages of a fossil and the expected age of a lineage do coincide, the fossils will be particularly useful in constraining node ages in molecularclock analyses." author="Berbee" cit-number="1942" pubmed-id="0" ref-id="Berbee2010a" time="308.47" year="2010" title="Dating the molecular clock in fungi  how close are we?" />

Phylogenetic analyses using both nucleotide and amino acid data of mt genes support monophyly of neobatrachians.

We also checked the influence of the data types and the settings of reference times on divergence time estimation. The resultant divergence times estimated from several datasets and reference time settings suggest that the substitution saturation of nucleotide data may lead to overestimated (i.e., older) branching times, especially for early divergent taxa.

By virtue of their position basal to bony vertebrates, cartilaginous fishes (class Chondrichthyes) are a valuable outgroup in comparative studies of vertebrates. Recently, a holocephalan cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark, Callorhinchus milii (Subclass Holocephali: Order Chimaeriformes), has been proposed as a model genome, and low-coverage sequence of its genome has been generated. Despite such an increasing interest, the evolutionary history of the modern holocephalans-a previously successful and diverse group but represented by only 39 extant species-and their relationship with elasmobranchs and other jawed vertebrates has been poorly documented largely owing to a lack of well-preserved fossil materials after the end-Permian about 250 Ma. In this study, we assembled the whole mitogenome sequences for eight representatives from all the three families of the modern holocephalans and investigated their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history. Unambiguously aligned sequences from these holocephalans together with 17 other vertebrates (9,409 nt positions excluding entire third codon positions) were subjected to partitioned maximum likelihood analysis. The resulting tree strongly supported a single origin of the modern holocephalans and their sister-group relationship with elasmobranchs. The mitogenomic tree recovered the most basal callorhinchids within the chimaeriforms, which is sister to a clade comprising the remaining two families (rhinochimaerids and chimaerids). The timetree derived from a relaxed molecular clock Bayesian method suggests that the holocephalans originated in the Silurian about 420 Ma, having survived from the end-Permian (250 Ma) mass extinction and undergoing familial diversifications during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous (170-120 Ma).

This study also provided a good opportunity to compare molecular evolutionary modes of mitogenomes among different iguanian lineages." author="Okajima" cit-number="1246" pubmed-id="20465814" ref-id="" time="328.39" year="2010" title="Mitochondrial genomes of acrodont lizards: timing of gene rearrangements and phylogenetic and biogeographic implications." />
<circle cx="46" cy="501" r="6" fill="url(#dotsGradient)" abstract="The geographic and temporal origins of Madagascar's biota have long been in the center of debate. We reconstructed a time-tree including nearly all native nonflying and nonmarine vertebrate clades present on the island, from DNA sequences of two single-copy protein-coding nuclear genes (BDNF and RAG1) and a set of congruent time constraints. Reconstructions calculated with autocorrelated or independent substitution rates over clades agreed in placing the origins of the 31 included clades in Cretaceous to Cenozoic times. The two clades with sister groups in South America were the oldest, followed by those of a putative Asian ancestry that were significantly older than the prevalent clades of African ancestry. No colonizations from Asia occurred after the Eocene, suggesting that dispersal and vicariance of Asian/Indian groups were favored over a comparatively short period during, and shortly after, the separation of India and Madagascar. Species richness of clades correlates with their age but those clades that have a large proportion of species diversity in rainforests are significantly more species-rich. This finding suggests an underlying pattern of continuous speciation through time in Madagascar's vertebrates, with accelerated episodes of adaptive diversification in those clades that succeeded radiating into the rainforests." author="Crottini" cit-number="2414" pubmed-id="22431616" ref-id="" time="329.11" year="2012" title="Vertebrate time-tree elucidates the biogeographic pattern of a major biotic change around the K-T boundary in Madagascar." />
<circle cx="46" cy="518" r="6" fill="url(#dotsGradient)" abstract="Although macroscopic plants, animals, and fungi are the most familiar eukaryotes, the bulk of eukaryotic diversity is microbial. Elucidating the timing of diversification among the more than 70 lineages is key to understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. Here, we use taxon-rich multigene data combined with diverse fossils and a relaxed molecular clock framework to estimate the timing of the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes and the divergence of major clades. Overall, these analyses suggest that the last common ancestor lived between 1866 and 1679 Ma, consistent with the earliest microfossils interpreted with confidence as eukaryotic. During this interval, the Earth's surface differed markedly from today; for example, the oceans were incompletely ventilated, with ferruginous and, after about 1800 Ma, sulfidic water masses commonly lying beneath moderately oxygenated surface waters. Our time estimates also indicate that the major clades of eukaryotes diverged before 1000 Ma, with most or all probably diverging before 1200 Ma. Fossils, however, suggest that diversity within major extant clades expanded later, beginning about 800 Ma, when the oceans began their transition to a more modern chemical state. In combination, paleontological and molecular approaches indicate that long stems preceded diversification in the major eukaryotic lineages." author="Parfrey" cit-number="2228" pubmed-id="21810989" ref-id="" time="334.72" year="2011" title="Estimating the timing of early eukaryotic diversification with multigene molecular clocks." />
