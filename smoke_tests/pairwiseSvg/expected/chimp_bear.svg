<circle cx="46" cy="40" r="6" fill="url(#dotsGradient)" abstract="The evolution of the main regulatory region (D-loop) of the mammalian mitochondrial genome was analyzed by comparing the sequences of eight mammalian species: human, common chimpanzee, pygmy chimpanzee, dolphin, cow, rat, mouse, and rabbit. The best alignment of the sequences was obtained by optimization of the sequence similarities common to all these species. The two peripheral left and right D-loop domains, which contain the main regulatory elements so far discovered, evolved rapidly in a species-specific manner generating heterogeneity in both length and base composition. They are prone to the insertion and deletion of elements and to the generation of short repeats by replication slippage. However, the preservation of some sequence blocks and similar cloverleaf-like structures in these regions, indicates a basic similarity in the regulatory mechanisms of the mitochondrial genome in all mammalian species. We found, particularly in the right domain, significant similarities to the telomeric sequences of the mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear DNA of Tetrahymena thermophila. These sequences may be interpreted as relics of telomeres present in ancestral linear forms of mtDNA or may simply represent efficient templates of RNA primase-like enzymes. Due to their peculiar evolution, the two peripheral domains cannot be used to estimate in a quantitative way the genetic distances between mammalian species. On the other hand the central domain, highly conserved during evolution, behaves as a good molecular clock. Reliable estimates of the times of divergence between closely and distantly related species were obtained from the central domain using a Markov model and assuming nonhomogeneous evolution of nucleotide sites." author="Saccone" cit-number="769" pubmed-id="1909377" ref-id="" time="45.4" year="1991" title="The main regulatory region of mammalian mitochondrial DNA: structure-function model and evolutionary pattern." />

The new sequence data obtained here for mouse RH50 and RH30 and for macaque RH50 allowed us to compare the evolutionary rates of the two genes and to show that RH50 evolved about 2.6 times more slowly than RH30 at nonsynonymous positions. This result implies that Rh50 proteins were evolutionarily more conserved compared to Rh30 polypeptides, thus being indicative of the functional significance of the former protein in species as distantly related as sponge and human. The duplication event leading to RH50 and RH30 genes was estimated to have occurred between 250 and 346 million years ago. Moreover, we could also estimate that the duplication event producing the RHCE and RHD genes occurred some 8.5 +/- 3.4 million years ago, in the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Interestingly, this event seems to coincide with the appearance in these species of a G-to-T mutation in the RH50 gene which created a stop codon in the corresponding transcript. This led to an Rh50 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain shorter than that found in orangutan and early primates." author="Matassi" cit-number="371" pubmed-id="9929383" ref-id="" time="65.3" year="1999" title="The members of the RH gene family (RH50 and RH30) followed different evolutionary pathways." />
<circle cx="46" cy="129" r="6" fill="url(#dotsGradient)" abstract="The expansion of C4 plants is thought to have profound effects on the faunal turnover of large mammals during the latest Miocene. However, it is unclear whether this event also induced extinction and range contraction of small mammals. Pikas (Ochotonidae) are highly adapted to arctic or alpine environments, and are considered ideal indicators in biochronology. Previous studies have demonstrated that large numbers of ochotonides were widely geographically distributed in the middle Miocene, although most went extinct in the late Miocene. It is uncertain whether their extinction was induced by the accelerated expansion of C4 plants. A comprehensive review of the worldwide fossil occurrence in Ochotonidae and a detailed analysis of its historical biogeography are also lacking. Here, we categorize plants that are selected by extant pikas for food and hay piles according to their photosynthesis pathway. Fossil records of Ochotonidae are also reviewed. The divergence time within Ochotona is estimated using multiple fossil calibrators and the combined matrix of two mitochondrial genes. We also infer the historical biogeography of Ochotona using event based methods (S-DIVA, Bayes-DIVA and Maximum Parsimony). The expansion of C4 plants in the late Miocene may have resulted in the extinction and range contraction of pikas. This hypothesis is supported by the prominent preference of C3 plants in extant pikas. The QinghaiTibet Plateau is identified as the most likely ancestral center or origin of extant Ochotona. Evolution of the pikas' geographical range shows a strong concordance with the global climate and paleoecological change. Their historical extinction and recent range contraction, as well as future survival prospects, appear to be closely associated with climate-driven vegetation changes in their habitats." author="Ge" cit-number="2424" pubmed-id="0" ref-id="Ge2012a" time="65.57" year="2012" title="Did the expansion of C4 plants drive extinction and massive range contraction of micromammals?

<circle cx="46" cy="148" r="6" fill="url(#dotsGradient)" abstract="The timing of the origin and diversification of rodents remains controversial, due to conflicting results from molecular clocks and paleontological data. The fossil record tends to support an early Cenozoic origin of crown-group rodents. In contrast, most molecular studies place the origin and initial diversification of crown-Rodentia deep in the Cretaceous, although some molecular analyses have recovered estimated divergence times that are more compatible with the fossil record. Here we attempt to resolve this conflict by carrying out a molecular clock investigation based on a nine-gene sequence dataset and a novel set of seven fossil constraints, including two new rodent records (the earliest known representatives of Cardiocraniinae and Dipodinae). Our results indicate that rodents originated around 61.7-62.4 Ma, shortly after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary, and diversified at the intraordinal level around 57.7-58.9 Ma. These estimates are broadly consistent with the paleontological record, but challenge previous molecular studies that place the origin and early diversification of rodents in the Cretaceous. This study demonstrates that, with reliable fossil constraints, the incompatibility between paleontological and molecular estimates of rodent divergence times can be eliminated using currently available tools and genetic markers. Similar conflicts between molecular and paleontological evidence bedevil attempts to establish the origination times of other placental groups. The example of the present study suggests that more reliable fossil calibration points may represent the key to resolving these controversies." author="Wu" cit-number="3055" pubmed-id="23071573" ref-id="" time="69.8" year="2012" title="Molecular and paleontological evidence for a post-Cretaceous origin of rodents." />

This placement is based primarily on characters related to a single feature, the enlarged mandibular canal, which supplies blood vessels and dense electrosensory receptors to the platypus bill. Our reevaluation of the morphological data instead groups platypus and echidnas to the exclusion of Teinolophos and Steropodon and suggests that an enlarged mandibular canal is ancestral for monotremes (partly reversed in echidnas, in association with general mandibular reduction). A multigene evaluation of the echidna-platypus divergence using both a relaxed molecular clock and direct fossil calibrations reveals a recent split of 19-48 million years ago. Platypus-like monotremes (Monotrematum) predate this divergence, indicating that echidnas had aquatically foraging ancestors that reinvaded terrestrial ecosystems. This ecological shift and the associated radiation of echidnas represent a recent expansion of niche space despite potential competition from marsupials. Monotremes might have survived the invasion of marsupials into Australasia by exploiting ecological niches in which marsupials are restricted by their reproductive mode.

Phylogenetic analyses support a strong topology, confirming the monophyly for all the major primate clades. In contrast to previous mitogenomic studies, the positions of tarsiers and colugos relative to strepsirrhines and anthropoids are well resolved. In order to improve our understanding of how fossil calibrations affect age estimates within primates, we explore the effect of seventeen fossil calibrations across primates and other mammalian groups and we select a subset of calibrations to date our mitogenomic tree. The divergence date estimates of the Strepsirrhine/Haplorhine split support an origin of crown primates in the Late Cretaceous, at around 74Ma.

The effects of purifying selection were comparable in all species, leading to a significant major proportion of nonsynonymous variants with higher pathogenicity scores in the younger branches of the tree.

Tribospheny allows for both shearing and grinding occlusal functions. Marsupials and placentals are advanced tribosphenic mammals (i.e., Theria) that show additional modifications of the tribosphenic dentition including loss of the distal metacristid and development of double-rank postvallum/prevallid shear. The recent discovery of Eomaia [Nature 416 (2002) 816], regarded as the oldest eutherian mammal, implies that the marsupial-placental split is at least 125 million years old. The conventional scenario for the evolution of tribosphenic and therian mammals hypothesizes that each group evolved once, in the northern hemisphere, and is based on a predominantly Laurasian fossil record. With the recent discovery of the oldest tribosphenic mammal (Ambondro) from the Mesozoic of Gondwana, Flynn et al.

Here, we present cladistic evidence for a single origin of tribosphenic molars. Further, Ambondro may be a stem eutherian, making the split between marsupials and placentals at least 167 m.y. old.

In a model encompassing a total of 67 species and genera from 12 mammalian orders, adult brain mass and two dichotomous variables reflecting species differences regarding limb biomechanics and dietary profile, accounted for 75.5%, 10.3% and 3.4% of variance in time to weaning, respectively, together capturing 89.2% of total variance. Crucially, carnivory predicted the time point of early weaning in humans with remarkable precision, yielding a prediction error of less than 5% with a sample of forty-six human natural fertility societies as reference. Hence, carnivory appears to provide both a necessary and sufficient explanation as to why humans wean so much earlier than the great apes. While early weaning is regarded as essentially differentiating the genus Homo from the great apes, its timing seems to be determined by the same limited set of factors in humans as in mammals in general, despite some 90 million years of evolution. Our analysis emphasizes the high degree of similarity of relative time scales in mammalian development and life history across 67 genera from 12 mammalian orders and shows that the impact of carnivory on time to weaning in humans is quantifiable, and critical.

However, despite considerable efforts these relationships, crucial to the understanding of eutherian evolution and biogeography, have remained essentially unresolved. Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria are generally joined into a common clade (Boreoeutheria), whereas the position of Afrotheria and Xenarthra relative to Boreoeutheria has been equivocal in spite of the use of comprehensive amounts of nuclear encoded sequences or the application of genome-level characters such as retroposons. The probable reason for this uncertainty is that the divergences took place long time ago and within a narrow temporal window, leaving only short common branches. With the aim of further examining basal eutherian relationships, we have collected conserved protein-coding sequences from 11 placental mammals, a marsupial and a bird, whose nuclear genomes have been largely sequenced.

Application of these methods to a dataset of 104 proteins from several vertebrate species indicated that the divergence times between humans and mice and between mice and rats are about 96 and 33 million years (MY) ago, respectively.

The phylogeny provides support for Lissamphibia, Theria, Lepidosauria, a turtle-archosaur clade, as well as most traditionally accepted groupings. This tree allows simultaneous molecular clock dating for all tetrapod groups using a set of well-corroborated calibrations. Relaxed clock (PLRS) methods, using the amniote = 315 Mya (million years ago) calibration or a set of consistent calibrations, recovers reasonable divergence dates for most groups. However, the analysis systematically underestimates divergence dates within archosaurs. The bird-crocodile split, robustly documented in the fossil record as being around approximately 245 Mya, is estimated at only approximately 190 Mya, and dates for other divergences within archosaurs are similarly underestimated. Archosaurs, and particulary turtles have slow apparent rates possibly confounding rate modeling, and inclusion of calibrations within archosaurs (despite their high deviances) not only improves divergence estimates within archosaurs, but also across other groups. Notably, the monotreme-therian split ( approximately 210 Mya) matches the fossil record; the squamate radiation ( approximately 190 Mya) is younger than suggested by some recent molecular studies and inconsistent with identification of approximately 220 and approximately 165 Myo (million-year-old) fossils as acrodont iguanians and approximately 95 Myo fossils colubroid snakes; the bird-lizard (reptile) split is considerably older than fossil estimates (&amp;lt; or = 285 Mya); and Sphenodon is a remarkable phylogenetic relic, being the sole survivor of a lineage more than a quarter of a billion years old. Comparison with other molecular clock studies of tetrapod divergences suggests that the common practice of enforcing most calibrations as minima, with a single liberal maximal constraint, will systematically overestimate divergence dates.

Some inconsistencies have nevertheless persisted, notably with respect to basal divergences. The current study has aimed to extend the representation of groups, whose position in the placental tree has been difficult to establish in mitogenomic studies. Both ML (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian analyses identified four basal monophyletic groups, Afroplacentalia (=Afrotheria: Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, Sirenia, Tenrecidea, Tubulidentata, Macroscelidea, Chrysochloridea), Xenarthra, Archontoglires (Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Lagomorpha, Rodentia) and Laurasiaplacentalia (Lipotyphla, Chiroptera, Pholidota, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, Cetacea). All analyses joined Archontoglires and Laurasiaplacentalia on a common branch (Boreoplacentalia), but the relationship between Afroplacentalia, Xenarthra and Boreoplacentalia was not conclusively resolved. The phylogenomic hypothesis with a sister group relationship between Notoplacentalia (Afroplacentalia/Xenarthra) and Boreoplacentalia served as the basis for estimating the times of placental divergences using paleontologically well-supported mammalian calibration points. These estimates placed the basal placental divergence between Boreoplacentalia and Notoplacentalia at approximately 102 MYA (million years ago). The current estimates of ordinal placental divergences are congruent with recent estimates based on nuclear data, but inconsistent with paleontological notions that have placed the origin of essentially all placental orders within an interval of 5-10 MY in the early Tertiary. Among less deep divergences the estimates placed the split between Gorilla and Pan/Homo at approximately 11.5 MYA and that between Pan and Homo at approximately 8 MYA. As a consequence of these estimates, which are in accord with recent progress in primate paleontology, the earliest divergences among recent humans become placed approximately 270,000 years ago, i.e. approximately 100,000 years earlier than the traditional age of &amp;quot;Mitochondrial Eve&amp;quot;.

Among mammals, bats possess unique traits that place unusual demands on their vestibular systems. First, bats are capable of powered flight, which in birds is associated with enlarged semicircular canals. Second, many bats have enlarged cochleae associated with echolocation, and both cochleae and semicircular canals share a space within the petrosal bone. To determine how bat vestibular systems have evolved in the face of these pressures, we used micro-CT scans to compare canal morphology across species with contrasting flight and echolocation capabilities. We found no increase in canal radius in bats associated with the acquisition of powered flight, but canal radius did correlate with body mass in bat species from the suborder Yangochiroptera, and also in non-echolocating Old World fruit bats from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull. Thus in many echolocating bats, it seems that the combination of small body size and enlarged cochlea together act as a principal force on the vestibular system. The two main groups of echolocating bats displayed different canal morphologies, in terms of size and shape in relation to body mass and cochlear size, thus suggesting independent evolutionary pathways and offering tentative support for multiple acquisitions of echolocation." author="Davies" cit-number="3275" pubmed-id="23637943" ref-id="" time="101.63" year="2013" title="The evolution of bat vestibular systems in the face of potential antagonistic selection pressures for flight and echolocation." />

Furthermore, we used AGY data sets for phylogenetic analyses in order to remove the effect of different C/T composition bias across species.
