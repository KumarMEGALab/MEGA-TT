Second, many bats have enlarged cochleae associated with echolocation, and both cochleae and semicircular canals share a space within the petrosal bone. To determine how bat vestibular systems have evolved in the face of these pressures, we used micro-CT scans to compare canal morphology across species with contrasting flight and echolocation capabilities. We found no increase in canal radius in bats associated with the acquisition of powered flight, but canal radius did correlate with body mass in bat species from the suborder Yangochiroptera, and also in non-echolocating Old World fruit bats from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull. Thus in many echolocating bats, it seems that the combination of small body size and enlarged cochlea together act as a principal force on the vestibular system.

In a model encompassing a total of 67 species and genera from 12 mammalian orders, adult brain mass and two dichotomous variables reflecting species differences regarding limb biomechanics and dietary profile, accounted for 75.5%, 10.3% and 3.4% of variance in time to weaning, respectively, together capturing 89.2% of total variance. Crucially, carnivory predicted the time point of early weaning in humans with remarkable precision, yielding a prediction error of less than 5% with a sample of forty-six human natural fertility societies as reference. Hence, carnivory appears to provide both a necessary and sufficient explanation as to why humans wean so much earlier than the great apes. While early weaning is regarded as essentially differentiating the genus Homo from the great apes, its timing seems to be determined by the same limited set of factors in humans as in mammals in general, despite some 90 million years of evolution. Our analysis emphasizes the high degree of similarity of relative time scales in mammalian development and life history across 67 genera from 12 mammalian orders and shows that the impact of carnivory on time to weaning in humans is quantifiable, and critical.

Both ML (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian analyses identified four basal monophyletic groups, Afroplacentalia (=Afrotheria: Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, Sirenia, Tenrecidea, Tubulidentata, Macroscelidea, Chrysochloridea), Xenarthra, Archontoglires (Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Lagomorpha, Rodentia) and Laurasiaplacentalia (Lipotyphla, Chiroptera, Pholidota, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, Cetacea). All analyses joined Archontoglires and Laurasiaplacentalia on a common branch (Boreoplacentalia), but the relationship between Afroplacentalia, Xenarthra and Boreoplacentalia was not conclusively resolved. The phylogenomic hypothesis with a sister group relationship between Notoplacentalia (Afroplacentalia\/Xenarthra) and Boreoplacentalia served as the basis for estimating the times of placental divergences using paleontologically well-supported mammalian calibration points. These estimates placed the basal placental divergence between Boreoplacentalia and Notoplacentalia at approximately 102 MYA (million years ago). The current estimates of ordinal placental divergences are congruent with recent estimates based on nuclear data, but inconsistent with paleontological notions that have placed the origin of essentially all placental orders within an interval of 5-10 MY in the early Tertiary. Among less deep divergences the estimates placed the split between Gorilla and Pan\/Homo at approximately 11.5 MYA and that between Pan and Homo at approximately 8 MYA.

This tree allows simultaneous molecular clock dating for all tetrapod groups using a set of well-corroborated calibrations. Relaxed clock (PLRS) methods, using the amniote = 315 Mya (million years ago) calibration or a set of consistent calibrations, recovers reasonable divergence dates for most groups.

The bird-crocodile split, robustly documented in the fossil record as being around approximately 245 Mya, is estimated at only approximately 190 Mya, and dates for other divergences within archosaurs are similarly underestimated. Archosaurs, and particulary turtles have slow apparent rates possibly confounding rate modeling, and inclusion of calibrations within archosaurs (despite their high deviances) not only improves divergence estimates within archosaurs, but also across other groups. Notably, the monotreme-therian split ( approximately 210 Mya) matches the fossil record; the squamate radiation ( approximately 190 Mya) is younger than suggested by some recent molecular studies and inconsistent with identification of approximately 220 and approximately 165 Myo (million-year-old) fossils as acrodont iguanians and approximately 95 Myo fossils colubroid snakes; the bird-lizard (reptile) split is considerably older than fossil estimates (< or = 285 Mya); and Sphenodon is a remarkable phylogenetic relic, being the sole survivor of a lineage more than a quarter of a billion years old. Comparison with other molecular clock studies of tetrapod divergences suggests that the common practice of enforcing most calibrations as minima, with a single liberal maximal constraint, will systematically overestimate divergence dates.

Using rooted and unrooted phylogenies derived from distinct theoretical approaches, strong support for the divergence of four principal clades of eutherian mammals was achieved. Minimum divergence dates of the earliest nodes in the placental mammal phylogeny were estimated with a quartet-based maximum-likelihood method that accommodates rate variation among lineages using conservative fossil calibrations from nine different nodes in the eutherian tree. These minimum estimates resolve the earliest placental mammal divergence nodes at periods between 64 and 104 million years ago, in essentially every case predating the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary. The pattern and timing of these divergences allow a geographic interpretation of the primary branching events in eutherian history, likely originating in the southern supercontinent Gondwanaland coincident with its breakup into Africa and South America 95-105 million years ago. We propose an integrated genomic, paleontological, and biogeographic hypothesis to account for these earliest splits on the placental mammal family tree and address current discrepancies between fossil and molecular evidence.","author":"Eizirik","title":"Molecular dating and biogeography of the early placental mammal radiation.","year":2001,"taxon_a":"chimpanzee","taxon_b":"Ursus","time":83.5,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":511,"pubmed_id":8622763,"ref_id":"Hedges1996a","abst":"To increase knowledge about the systematics and evolution of Mediterranean soles, we assessed mitochondrial DNA variation, molecular phylogeny, and evolution in eight species from the genera Solen, Microchirus, Monochirus, and Buglossidium by large ribosomal subunit (16S) and cytochrome b (cytb) sequence analysis. Relevant molecular features are the great variation of base composition among species at the third codon in cytb and the heterogeneity of the nucleotide substitution rate. Phylogenies recovered using 16S nucleotide and cytb amino acid sequences agree with those based on morphology in assessing monophyly of Solea species and ancestry of Buglossidium luteum, but they are against the intergeneric differentiation of Microchirus and Monochirus. Conversely, phylogenetic trees based on cytb nucleotide sequences yielded relationships among taxa regardless of their evolutionary histories. The incongruities between morphological and molecular issues suggest the need for reassessing the systematic value of some morphological characters. Approximate estimates of the divergence time of Mediterranean soleid lineages range from 40 to 13 Mya (Oligocene-Miocene), indicating an ancient origin for the group.","author":"Hedges","title":"Continental breakup and the ordinal diversification of birds and mammals","year":2000,"taxon_a":"chimpanzee","taxon_b":"Ursus","time":101.5,"tree_count":4,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":137,"pubmed_id":12078636,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Using the set of all vertebrate mtDNA protein sequences published as of May 1998, plus unpublished examples for elephant and birds, we examined divergence times in Placentalia and Aves.

The new sequence data obtained here for mouse RH50 and RH30 and for macaque RH50 allowed us to compare the evolutionary rates of the two genes and to show that RH50 evolved about 2.6 times more slowly than RH30 at nonsynonymous positions. This result implies that Rh50 proteins were evolutionarily more conserved compared to Rh30 polypeptides, thus being indicative of the functional significance of the former protein in species as distantly related as sponge and human. The duplication event leading to RH50 and RH30 genes was estimated to have occurred between 250 and 346 million years ago. Moreover, we could also estimate that the duplication event producing the RHCE and RHD genes occurred some 8.5 +\/- 3.4 million years ago, in the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Interestingly, this event seems to coincide with the appearance in these species of a G-to-T mutation in the RH50 gene which created a stop codon in the corresponding transcript. This led to an Rh50 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain shorter than that found in orangutan and early primates.","author":"Matassi","title":"The members of the RH gene family (RH50 and RH30) followed different evolutionary pathways.","year":1999,"taxon_a":"chimpanzee","taxon_b":"Ursus","time":65.299999999999997,"tree_count":2,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":148,"pubmed_id":9582070,"ref_id":null,"abst":"A timescale is necessary for estimating rates of molecular and morphological change in organisms and for interpreting patterns of macroevolution and biogeography.

The best alignment of the sequences was obtained by optimization of the sequence similarities common to all these species. The two peripheral left and right D-loop domains, which contain the main regulatory elements so far discovered, evolved rapidly in a species-specific manner generating heterogeneity in both length and base composition. They are prone to the insertion and deletion of elements and to the generation of short repeats by replication slippage. However, the preservation of some sequence blocks and similar cloverleaf-like structures in these regions, indicates a basic similarity in the regulatory mechanisms of the mitochondrial genome in all mammalian species. We found, particularly in the right domain, significant similarities to the telomeric sequences of the mitochondrial (mt) and nuclear DNA of Tetrahymena thermophila. These sequences may be interpreted as relics of telomeres present in ancestral linear forms of mtDNA or may simply represent efficient templates of RNA primase-like enzymes. Due to their peculiar evolution, the two peripheral domains cannot be used to estimate in a quantitative way the genetic distances between mammalian species. On the other hand the central domain, highly conserved during evolution, behaves as a good molecular clock. Reliable estimates of the times of divergence between closely and distantly related species were obtained from the central domain using a Markov model and assuming nonhomogeneous evolution of nucleotide sites.","author":"Saccone","title":"The main regulatory region of mammalian mitochondrial DNA: structure-function model and evolutionary pattern.","year":1991,"taxon_a":"chimpanzee","taxon_b":"Ursus","time":45.399999999999999,"tree_count":2,"css_class":""}],"sum_simple_mol_time":"94","sum_median_time":"94","topology_ancestor_id":172907,"all_total":62,"link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9598&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9639&lvl=0&srchmode=1","studies":{"time_estimates":"{76.7,94,74.5,144.1,101,94,90,92,107.2,151.5,95,88,92,93,114,97.8,83.2,65.3,83.5,93.3,128.7,92.8,94,90,113,81,97.4,98.9,98,45.4,85.6,80,116.6052,89.5968,99,95.31,83.3,95,88.60567,74.57,96.4,92.68,83.01,117.8023,83.8547,65.57,105.7,97.4,96.2,92.38175,88.6,69.8,94.5141,101.63443,88.0229,61.965,79.9,113,103.85215,113.30553,92.23171,109.2872}","0":"{76.7,94,74.5,144.1,101,94,90,92,107.2,151.5,95,88,92,93,114,97.8,83.2,65.3,83.5,93.3,128.7,92.8,94,90,113,81,97.4,98.9,98,45.4,85.6,80,116.6052,89.5968,99,95.31,83.3,95,88.60567,74.57,96.4,92.68,83.01,117.8023,83.8547,65.57,105.7,97.4,96.2,92.38175,88.6,69.8,94.5141,101.63443,88.0229,61.965,79.9,113,103.85215,113.30553,92.23171,109.2872}","topology_node_id":172907,"1":172907,"precomputed_age":94,"2":"94","precomputed_ci_low":89.596800000000002,"3":"89.5968","precomputed_ci_high":97.400000000000006,"4":"97.4","adjusted_age":0,"5":null,"ci_string":"CI: (89.5968 - 97.4)","6":"CI: (89.5968 - 97.4)","preadjusted_age":0}}
