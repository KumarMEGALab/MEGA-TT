Fortunately, new and interesting fungal fossils are being discovered and we review some of the new discoveries that confirm the ancient origin of important taxa.

We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for >85% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced \"living fossils.\" In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.","author":"Alfaro","title":"Nine exceptional radiations plus high turnover explain species diversity in jawed vertebrates.","year":2009,"taxon_a":"Ursus","taxon_b":"Enhydris","time":320.32999999999998,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":2438,"pubmed_id":null,"ref_id":"Hedges2009TTOL","abst":"","author":"Hedges","title":"The TimeTree of Life","year":2009,"taxon_a":"Ursus","taxon_b":"Enhydris","time":324.5,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":1624,"pubmed_id":18670139,"ref_id":null,"abst":"The mitochondrial genomes of the Komodo monitor (Varanus komodoensis) and the Nile monitor (V. niloticus) were previously shown to have an extensive gene rearrangement.

Based on phylogenetic relationships of the varanids constructed using mitochondrial DNA sequences encoding the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene and seven flanking tRNA genes, we estimated their divergence times by the Bayesian method without assuming the molecular clock. The results suggested that the mitochondrial DNA gene rearrangement took place once in an ancestral varanid lineage in the Paleocene or earlier.

The gene arrangements of these genomes diverged from that of basal anurans (suborder Archaeobatrachia), but are the same as that of the members of derived frogs (i.e., superfamily Hyloidae and Ranoidae in suborder Neobatrachia), suggesting the one-time occurrence of a gene rearrangement event in an ancestral lineage of derived anurans. Furthermore, several distinct repeat motifs including putative termination-associated sequences (TASs) and conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) were observed in the control regions (CRs) of B. japonicus and H. japonica, while no repeat motifs were found in that of M. okinavensis. Phylogenetic analyses using both nucleotide and amino acid data of mt genes support monophyly of neobatrachians. The estimated divergence time based on amino acid data with multiple reference points suggests that the three living amphibian orders may have originated in the Carboniferous period, and that the divergences of anurans had occurred between the Permian and Tertiary periods. We also checked the influence of the data types and the settings of reference times on divergence time estimation. The resultant divergence times estimated from several datasets and reference time settings suggest that the substitution saturation of nucleotide data may lead to overestimated (i.e., older) branching times, especially for early divergent taxa. We also found a highly accelerated substitution rate in neobatrachian mt genes, and fast substitution possibly resulted in overestimation. To correct this erroneous estimation, it is efficient to apply several reference points among neobatrachians.","author":"Igawa","title":"Complete mitochondrial genomes of three neobatrachian anurans: a case study of divergence time estimation using different data and calibration settings.","year":2008,"taxon_a":"Ursus","taxon_b":"Enhydris","time":312,"tree_count":1,"css_class":"new_study"},{"citation_num":744,"pubmed_id":18077422,"ref_id":null,"abst":"A phylogeny and timescale derived from analyses of multilocus nuclear DNA sequences for Holarctic genera of plethodontid salamanders reveal them to be an old radiation whose common ancestor diverged from sister taxa in the late Jurassic and underwent rapid diversification during the late Cretaceous. A North American origin of plethodontids was followed by a continental-wide diversification, not necessarily centered only in the Appalachian region. The colonization of Eurasia by plethodontids most likely occurred once, by dispersal during the late Cretaceous. Subsequent diversification in Asia led to the origin of Hydromantes and Karsenia, with the former then dispersing both to Europe and back to North America. Salamanders underwent rapid episodes of diversification and dispersal that coincided with major global warming events during the late Cretaceous and again during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal optimum. The major clades of plethodontids were established during these episodes, contemporaneously with similar phenomena in angiosperms, arthropods, birds, and mammals. Periods of global warming may have promoted diversification and both inter- and transcontinental dispersal in northern hemisphere salamanders by making available terrain that shortened dispersal routes and offered new opportunities for adaptive and vicariant evolution.","author":"Vieites","title":"Rapid diversification and dispersal during periods of global warming by plethodontid salamanders.","year":2007,"taxon_a":"Ursus","taxon_b":"Enhydris","time":328,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":2086,"pubmed_id":17118581,"ref_id":null,"abst":"In placental mammals and birds, molecular data generally support a view that they diverged into their ordinal groups in good response to mid-Cretaceous continental fragmentations.

Here, I determined complete or nearly complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from seven lizard families and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships between major lizard families. When snakes were included, maximum likelihood analysis did not support a morphological view of the snakes-varanoids affinity, although several other competing hypotheses on the position of snakes still cannot be discriminated presumably due to extremely long branches of the snake lineages. I also conducted clock-free Bayesian analyses to show that divergence times between major lizard families were centered in Triassic-Jurassic times.
