They include familiar forms such as the spiny, slipper, clawed lobsters and crayfish and unfamiliar forms such as the deep-sea and &quot;living fossil&quot; species. The high degree of morphological diversity among these infraorders has led to a dynamic classification and conflicting hypotheses of evolutionary relationships. In this study, we estimated phylogenetic relationships among the major groups of all lobster families and 94% of the genera using six genes (mitochondrial and nuclear) and 195 morphological characters across 173 species of lobsters for the most comprehensive sampling to date. Lobsters were recovered as a non-monophyletic assemblage in the combined (molecular\u2009+\u2009morphology) analysis. All families were monophyletic, with the exception of Cambaridae, and 7 of 79 genera were recovered as poly- or paraphyletic. A rich fossil history coupled with dense taxon coverage allowed us to estimate and compare divergence times and origins of major lineages using two drastically different approaches. Age priors were constructed and\/or included based on fossil age information or fossil discovery, age, and extant species count data. Results from the two approaches were largely congruent across deep to shallow taxonomic divergences across major lineages. The origin of the first lobster-like decapod (Polychelida) was estimated in the Devonian (\u223c409-372 Ma) with all infraorders present in the Carboniferous (\u223c353-318 Ma). Fossil calibration subsampling studies examined the influence of sampling density (number of fossils) and placement (deep, middle, and shallow) on divergence time estimates. Results from our study suggest including at least 1 fossil per 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in divergence dating analyses.

The sequential break-up of Gondwana is thought to be a dominant process in the establishment of shared biota across landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere. Yet similar distributions are shared by taxa whose radiations clearly post-date the Gondwanan break-up. Thus, determining the contribution of vicariance versus dispersal to seemingly Gondwanan biota is complex. The southern freshwater crayfishes (family Parastacidae) are distributed on Australia and New Guinea, South America, Madagascar and New Zealand and are unlikely to have dispersed via oceans, owing to strict freshwater limitations. We test the hypotheses that the break-up of Gondwana has led to (1) a predominately eastwest (((Australia, New Zealand: 80 Ma) Madagascar: 160121 Ma) South America: 165140 Ma), or (2) a southern (((Australia, South America: 5235 Ma) New Zealand: 80 Ma) Madagascar: 160121 Ma) pattern for parastacid crayfish. Further, we examine the evidence for a complete drowning of New Zealand and subsequent colonization by freshwater crayfish. Location? Southern Hemisphere. Methods? The evolutionary relationships among the 15 genera of Parastacidae were reconstructed using mitochondrial [16S, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI)] and nuclear (18S, 28S) sequence data and maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic reconstruction. A Bayesian (multidivtime) molecular dating method using six fossil calibrations and phylogenetic inference was used to estimate divergence time among crayfish clades on Gondwanan landmasses. Results? The South American crayfish are monophyletic and a sister group to all other southern crayfish. Australian crayfish are not monophyletic, with two Tasmanian genera, Spinastacoides and Ombrastacoides, forming a clade with New Zealand and Malagasy crayfish (both monophyletic). Divergence of crayfish among southern landmasses is estimated to have occurred around the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (109178 Ma). Main conclusions? The estimated phylogenetic relationships and time of divergence among the Southern Hemisphere crayfishes were consistent with an eastwest pattern of Gondwanan divergence. The divergence between Australia and New Zealand (109160 Ma) pre-dated the rifting at around 80 Ma, suggesting that these lineages were established prior to the break-up. Owing to the age of the New Zealand crayfish, we reject the hypothesis that there was a complete drowning of New Zealand crayfish habitat.","author":"Toon","title":"Gondwanan radiation of the Southern Hemisphere crayfishes (Decapoda: Parastacidae): evidence from fossils and molecules","year":2010,"taxon_a":"Ombrastacoides huonensis","taxon_b":"Samastacus spinifrons","time":156.49000000000001,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""}],"sum_simple_mol_time":"184.422","sum_median_time":"186.13941","topology_ancestor_id":260924,"all_total":2,"link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=217112&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=108047&lvl=0&srchmode=1","studies":{"time_estimates":"{156.49,215.78882}","0":"{156.49,215.78882}","topology_node_id":260924,"1":260924,"precomputed_age":184.422,"2":"184.422","precomputed_ci_low":156.49000000000001,"3":"156.49","precomputed_ci_high":215.78881999999999,"4":"215.78882","adjusted_age":186.13941,"5":"186.13941","ci_string":"CI: (156.49 - 215.78882)","6":"CI: (156.49 - 215.78882)","preadjusted_age":186.13941}}
