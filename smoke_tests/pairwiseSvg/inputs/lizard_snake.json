Oviparity is the ancestral amniote state, and viviparity has evolved many times independently within amniotes (especially in lizards and snakes), with possibly a few reversions to oviparity. In amniotes, the shelled egg is considered a complex structure that is unlikely to re-evolve if lost (i.e., it is an example of Dollo's Principle). However, a recent ancestral state reconstruction analysis concluded that viviparity was the ancestral state of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), and that oviparity re-evolved from viviparity many times throughout the evolutionary history of squamates. Here, we re-evaluate support for this provocative conclusion by testing the sensitivity of the analysis to model assumptions and estimates of squamate phylogeny. We found that the models and methods used for parity mode reconstruction are highly sensitive to the specific estimate of phylogeny used, and that the point estimate of phylogeny used to suggest that viviparity is the root state of the squamate tree is far from an optimal phylogenetic solution. The ancestral state reconstructions are also highly sensitive to model choice and specific values of model parameters. A method that is designed to account for biases in taxon sampling actually accentuates, rather than lessens, those biases with respect to ancestral state reconstructions. In contrast to recent conclusions from the same data set, we find that ancestral state reconstruction analyses provide highly equivocal support for the number and direction of transitions between oviparity and viviparity in squamates. Moreover, the reconstructions of ancestral parity state are highly dependent on the assumptions of each model. We conclude that the common ancestor of squamates was oviparous, and subsequent evolutionary transitions to viviparity were common, but reversals to oviparity were rare. The three putative reversals to oviparity with the strongest phylogenetic support occurred in the snakes Eryx jayakari and Lachesis, and the lizard, Liolaemus calchaqui.

The results showed that the divergence time between Henophidia and Caenophidia was 109.50 Mya, 106.18 Mya for divergence between Acrochordus granulatus and the other snakes of the Caenophidia, the divergence time of A. meiguensis was 103 Mya, and Viperidae diverged from the unilateral of Elapidae and Colubridae was 96.06 Mya.","author":"Wang","title":"The complete mitochondrial DNA sequence and the phylogenetic position of Achalinus meiguensis (Reptilia: Squamata)","year":2009,"taxon_a":"Enhydris","taxon_b":"crocodile lizard","time":148.50999999999999,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":2438,"pubmed_id":null,"ref_id":"Hedges2009TTOL","abst":"","author":"Hedges","title":"The TimeTree of Life","year":2009,"taxon_a":"Enhydris","taxon_b":"crocodile lizard","time":166.40000000000001,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":663,"pubmed_id":18222097,"ref_id":null,"abst":null,"author":"Sanders","title":"Molecular evidence for a rapid late-Miocene radiation of Australasian venomous snakes (Elapidae, Colubroidea).","year":2008,"taxon_a":"Enhydris","taxon_b":"crocodile lizard","time":140,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":2086,"pubmed_id":17118581,"ref_id":null,"abst":"In placental mammals and birds, molecular data generally support a view that they diverged into their ordinal groups in good response to mid-Cretaceous continental fragmentations.

Here, I determined complete or nearly complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from seven lizard families and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships between major lizard families. When snakes were included, maximum likelihood analysis did not support a morphological view of the snakes-varanoids affinity, although several other competing hypotheses on the position of snakes still cannot be discriminated presumably due to extremely long branches of the snake lineages. I also conducted clock-free Bayesian analyses to show that divergence times between major lizard families were centered in Triassic-Jurassic times. Thus, lizards include much deeper divergences than the mammals and birds and they appear to have already radiated into various families prior to the mid-Cretaceous major continental fragmentation.","author":"Kumazawa","title":"Mitochondrial genomes from major lizard families suggest their phylogenetic relationships and ancient radiations.","year":2007,"taxon_a":"Enhydris","taxon_b":"crocodile lizard","time":212.34,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":2773,"pubmed_id":16568638,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Why does a trait evolve repeatedly within a clade? When examining the evolution of a trait, evolutionary biologists typically focus on the selective advantages it may confer and the genetic and developmental mechanisms that allow it to vary. Although these factors may be necessary to explain why a trait evolves in a particular instance, they may not be sufficient to explain phylogenetic patterns of repeated evolution or conservatism. Instead, other factors may also be important, such as biogeography and competitive interactions. In squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) a dramatic transition in body form has occurred repeatedly, from a fully limbed, lizardlike body form to a limb-reduced, elongate, snakelike body form. We analyze this trait in a phylogenetic and biogeographic context to address why this transition occurred so frequently. We included 261 species for which morphometric data and molecular phylogenetic information were available. Among the included species, snakelike body form has evolved about 25 times. Most lineages of snakelike squamates belong to one of two &quot;ecomorphs,&quot; either short-tailed burrowers or long-tailed surface dwellers. The repeated origins of snakelike squamates appear to be associated with the in situ evolution of these two ecomorphs on different continental regions (including multiple origins of the burrowing morph within most continents), with very little dispersal of most limb-reduced lineages between continental regions. Overall, the number of repeated origins of snakelike morphology seems to depend on large-scale biogeographic patterns and community ecology, in addition to more traditional explanations (e.g., selection, development).","author":"Wiens","title":"Why does a trait evolve multiple times within a clade?

Our analyses firmly support a sister relationship between Sphenodon and Squamata, which includes lizards and snakes. Using Sphenodon as an outgroup for select squamates, we found evidence indicating a sister relationship, among our study taxa, between Serpentes (represented by Dinodon) and Varanidae. Our analyses support monophyly of Archosauria, and a sister relationship between turtles and archosaurs. This latter relationship is congruent with a growing set of morphological and molecular analyses placing turtles within crown Diapsida and recognizing them as secondarily anapsid (lacking a skull fenestration). Inclusion of Sphenodon, as the only surviving member of Sphenodontia (with fossils from the mid-Triassic), helps to fill a sampling gap within previous analyses of reptilian phylogeny. We also report a unique configuration for the mitochondrial genome of Sphenodon, including two tRNA(Lys) copies and an absence of ND5, tRNA(His), and tRNA(Thr) genes.","author":"Rest","title":"Molecular systematics of primary reptilian lineages and the tuatara mitochondrial genome.","year":2003,"taxon_a":"Enhydris","taxon_b":"crocodile lizard","time":220,"tree_count":4,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":370,"pubmed_id":9767692,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Phylogenetic relationships among reptiles were examined using previously published and newly determined hemoglobin sequences. Trees reconstructed from these sequences using maximum-parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum-likelihood algorithms were compared with a phylogenetic tree of Amniota, which was assembled on the basis of published morphological data. All analyses differentiated alpha chains into alphaA and alphaD types, which are present in all reptiles except crocodiles, where only alphaA chains are expressed. The occurrence of the alphaD chain in squamates (lizards and snakes only in this study) appears to be a general characteristic of these species. Lizards and snakes also express two types of beta chains (betaI and betaII), while only one type of beta chain is present in birds and crocodiles. Reconstructed hemoglobin trees for both alpha and beta sequences did not yield the monophyletic Archosauria (i.e., crocodilians + birds) and Lepidosauria (i.e., Sphenodon + squamates) groups defined by the morphology tree. This discrepancy, as well as some other poorly resolved nodes, might be due to substantial heterogeneity in evolutionary rates among single hemoglobin lineages. Estimation of branch lengths based on uncorrected amino acid substitutions and on distances corrected for multiple substitutions (PAM distances) revealed that relative rates for squamate alphaA and alphaD chains and crocodilian beta chains are at least twice as high as those of the rest of the chains considered. In contrast to these rate inequalities between reptilian orders, little variation was found within squamates, which allowed determination of absolute evolutionary rates for this subset of hemoglobins. Rate estimates for hemoglobins of lizards and snakes yielded 1.7 (alphaA) and 3.3 (beta) million years\/PAM when calibrated with published divergence time vs. PAM distance correlates for several speciation events within snakes and for the squamate left and right arrow sphenodontid split. This suggests that hemoglobin chains of squamate reptiles evolved approximately 3.5 (alphaA) or approximately 1.7 times (beta) faster than their mammalian equivalents. These data also were used to obtain a first estimate of some intrasquamate divergence times.","author":"Gorr","title":"Phylogenetic analysis of reptilian hemoglobins: trees, rates, and divergences.","year":1998,"taxon_a":"Enhydris","taxon_b":"crocodile lizard","time":133,"tree_count":6,"css_class":""}],"sum_simple_mol_time":"161.035414","sum_median_time":"161.035414","topology_ancestor_id":185753,"all_total":28,"link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=39145&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=52224&lvl=0&srchmode=1","studies":{"time_estimates":"{179,220,124,142,140,161.716,163.916,219.1173,212.3401,146.5617,148.51,147.95,166.4,163.8,167.04935,140.80541,147,140.43,155.14372,198.91664,179.98662,184.56073,160.573446,161.035414,160.57345,162.26231,139.052,156.82904}","0":"{179,220,124,142,140,161.716,163.916,219.1173,212.3401,146.5617,148.51,147.95,166.4,163.8,167.04935,140.80541,147,140.43,155.14372,198.91664,179.98662,184.56073,160.573446,161.035414,160.57345,162.26231,139.052,156.82904}","topology_node_id":185753,"1":185753,"precomputed_age":161.035414,"2":"161.035414","precomputed_ci_low":148.50999999999999,"3":"148.51","precomputed_ci_high":166.40000000000001,"4":"166.4","adjusted_age":0,"5":null,"ci_string":"CI: (148.51 - 166.4)","6":"CI: (148.51 - 166.4)","preadjusted_age":0}}
