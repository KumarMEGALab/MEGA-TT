Of these, Solenodontidae includes only two extant species, which are endemic to the largest islands of the Greater Antilles: Cuba and Hispaniola. Most molecular studies suggest that eulipotyphlan families diverged from each other across several million years, with the basal split between Solenodontidae and other families occurring in the Late Cretaceous. By contrast, Sato et al. (2016) suggest that eulipotyphlan families diverged from each other in a polytomy \u223c58.6\u202fmillion years ago (Mya). This more recent divergence estimate for Solenodontidae versus other extant eulipotyphlans suggests that solenodons must have arrived in the Greater Antilles via overwater dispersal rather than vicariance. Here, we show that the young timetree estimates for eulipotyphlan families and the polytomy are due to an inverted ingroup-outgroup arrangement of the tree, the result of using Tracer rather than TreeAnnotator to compile interfamilial divergence times, and of not enforcing the monophly of well-established clades such as Laurasiatheria and Eulipotyphla.

Most previous molecular clock dating studies, however, have suffered from limited data and biases in methodologies, and virtually all have failed to acknowledge the large uncertainties associated with the fossil record of early animals, leading to inconsistent estimates among studies. Here we use an unprecedented amount of molecular data, combined with four fossil calibration strategies (reflecting disparate and controversial interpretations of the metazoan fossil record) to obtain Bayesian estimates of metazoan divergence times. Our results indicate that the uncertain nature of ancient fossils and violations of the molecular clock impose a limit on the precision that can be achieved in estimates of ancient molecular timescales. For example, although we can assert that crown Metazoa originated during the Cryogenian (with most crown-bilaterian phyla diversifying during the Ediacaran), it is not possible with current data to pinpoint the divergence events with sufficient accuracy to test for correlations between geological and biological events in the history of animals. Although a Cryogenian origin of crown Metazoa agrees with current geological interpretations, the divergence dates of the bilaterians remain controversial.

Here we present a comprehensive mitogenomic study of primates. We assembled 87 mammalian mitochondrial genomes, including 62 primate species representing all the families of the order.

The divergence date estimates of the Strepsirrhine\/Haplorhine split support an origin of crown primates in the Late Cretaceous, at around 74Ma.

Within ochotonids, more than 20 genera occupied the period from the early Miocene to middle Miocene, whereas most of them became extinct during the transition from the Miocene to Pliocene. The peak diversity of the leporids occurred during the Miocene to Pliocene transition, while their diversity dramatically decreased in the late Quaternary. Mantel tests identified a positive correlation between body length and phylogenetic distance of lagomorphs. The body length of extant ochotonids shows a normal distribution, while the body length of extant leporids displays a non-normal pattern. We also find that the forage selection of extant pikas features a strong preference for C(3) plants, while for the diet of leporids, more than 16% of plant species are identified as C(4) (31% species are from Poaceae). The ability of several leporid species to consume C(4) plants is likely to result in their size increase and range expansion, most notably in Lepus. Expansion of C(4) plants in the late Miocene, the so-called 'nature's green revolution', induced by global environmental change, is suggested to be one of the major 'ecological opportunities', which probably drove large-scale extinction and range contraction of ochotonids, but inversely promoted diversification and range expansion of leporids.","author":"Ge","title":"Evolutionary history of lagomorphs in response to global environmental change.","year":2013,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"house mouse","time":79.890000000000001,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":3206,"pubmed_id":23653398,"ref_id":null,"abst":"The tree of life of fishes is in a state of flux because we still lack a comprehensive phylogeny that includes all major groups.

Among mammals, bats possess unique traits that place unusual demands on their vestibular systems. First, bats are capable of powered flight, which in birds is associated with enlarged semicircular canals. Second, many bats have enlarged cochleae associated with echolocation, and both cochleae and semicircular canals share a space within the petrosal bone. To determine how bat vestibular systems have evolved in the face of these pressures, we used micro-CT scans to compare canal morphology across species with contrasting flight and echolocation capabilities. We found no increase in canal radius in bats associated with the acquisition of powered flight, but canal radius did correlate with body mass in bat species from the suborder Yangochiroptera, and also in non-echolocating Old World fruit bats from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull. Thus in many echolocating bats, it seems that the combination of small body size and enlarged cochlea together act as a principal force on the vestibular system. The two main groups of echolocating bats displayed different canal morphologies, in terms of size and shape in relation to body mass and cochlear size, thus suggesting independent evolutionary pathways and offering tentative support for multiple acquisitions of echolocation.","author":"Davies","title":"The evolution of bat vestibular systems in the face of potential antagonistic selection pressures for flight and echolocation.","year":2013,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"house mouse","time":85.359999999999999,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":2407,"pubmed_id":22536316,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Our large brain, long life span and high fertility are key elements of human evolutionary success and are often thought to have evolved in interplay with tool use, carnivory and hunting.

Crucially, carnivory predicted the time point of early weaning in humans with remarkable precision, yielding a prediction error of less than 5% with a sample of forty-six human natural fertility societies as reference. Hence, carnivory appears to provide both a necessary and sufficient explanation as to why humans wean so much earlier than the great apes. While early weaning is regarded as essentially differentiating the genus Homo from the great apes, its timing seems to be determined by the same limited set of factors in humans as in mammals in general, despite some 90 million years of evolution. Our analysis emphasizes the high degree of similarity of relative time scales in mammalian development and life history across 67 genera from 12 mammalian orders and shows that the impact of carnivory on time to weaning in humans is quantifiable, and critical.

Here we attempt to resolve this conflict by carrying out a molecular clock investigation based on a nine-gene sequence dataset and a novel set of seven fossil constraints, including two new rodent records (the earliest known representatives of Cardiocraniinae and Dipodinae). Our results indicate that rodents originated around 61.7-62.4 Ma, shortly after the Cretaceous\/Paleogene (K\/Pg) boundary, and diversified at the intraordinal level around 57.7-58.9 Ma. These estimates are broadly consistent with the paleontological record, but challenge previous molecular studies that place the origin and early diversification of rodents in the Cretaceous. This study demonstrates that, with reliable fossil constraints, the incompatibility between paleontological and molecular estimates of rodent divergence times can be eliminated using currently available tools and genetic markers. Similar conflicts between molecular and paleontological evidence bedevil attempts to establish the origination times of other placental groups. The example of the present study suggests that more reliable fossil calibration points may represent the key to resolving these controversies.","author":"Wu","title":"Molecular and paleontological evidence for a post-Cretaceous origin of rodents.","year":2012,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"house mouse","time":65.200000000000003,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":1536,"pubmed_id":21307956,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Beavers are one of the largest and ecologically most distinct rodent species.

In these studies the relationships among some orders of the super-clade Laurasiatheria were poorly supported, albeit not studied in detail. Therefore, 4775 protein-coding genes (6,196,263 nucleotides) were collected and aligned in order to analyze the evolution of this clade.

Thus, contrary to the common expectation to resolve major evolutionary events as a bifurcating tree, genome analyses unveil complex speciation processes even in deep mammalian divergences. We exemplify this on a subset of 1159 suitable genes that have individual histories, most likely due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgression, processes that can make the genealogy of mammalian genomes complex.

Although most mitochondrial (mt) analyses have suggested that rodents have a basal position in the eutherian tree, some nuclear data in combination with mt-rRNA genes have placed the root on the so-called African clade or on a branch that includes this clade and the Xenarthra (e.g., anteater and armadillo).

Marsupials and placentals are advanced tribosphenic mammals (i.e., Theria) that show additional modifications of the tribosphenic dentition including loss of the distal metacristid and development of double-rank postvallum\/prevallid shear. The recent discovery of Eomaia [Nature 416 (2002) 816], regarded as the oldest eutherian mammal, implies that the marsupial-placental split is at least 125 million years old. The conventional scenario for the evolution of tribosphenic and therian mammals hypothesizes that each group evolved once, in the northern hemisphere, and is based on a predominantly Laurasian fossil record. With the recent discovery of the oldest tribosphenic mammal (Ambondro) from the Mesozoic of Gondwana, Flynn et al.

Here, we present cladistic evidence for a single origin of tribosphenic molars. Further, Ambondro may be a stem eutherian, making the split between marsupials and placentals at least 167 m.y. old.

Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.","author":"Hasegawa","title":"Dating of the human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA.","year":1985,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"house mouse","time":92.299999999999997,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""}],"sum_simple_mol_time":"87.2","sum_median_time":"87.2","topology_ancestor_id":176463,"all_total":74,"link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9606&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=10090&lvl=0&srchmode=1","studies":{"time_estimates":"{105.9,68.4,86,70.5,93,117,120,91,85,84,107.2,88,84,129,115,90.8,109,112,95.5,95.5,89,100,65.42,65.28,84.8,70.6,69,103,95,120,68,91,94.5,83,88.8,108.5,92.3,97,73,89.7289,65.7279,75.99999,91.2524,88.4,170,75.13,79.6,81.00986,70.14,90.1,78.02,73.97,110.38355,75.7221,79.9,91,91.9,78.75854374,97.87978,82.1,79.89471,65.2,66.89,100.8,85.35713,81.33807,71.12,125.1589,58.401,35.96591,51.8736,90.46085,265.146,99.86882}","0":"{105.9,68.4,86,70.5,93,117,120,91,85,84,107.2,88,84,129,115,90.8,109,112,95.5,95.5,89,100,65.42,65.28,84.8,70.6,69,103,95,120,68,91,94.5,83,88.8,108.5,92.3,97,73,89.7289,65.7279,75.99999,91.2524,88.4,170,75.13,79.6,81.00986,70.14,90.1,78.02,73.97,110.38355,75.7221,79.9,91,91.9,78.75854374,97.87978,82.1,79.89471,65.2,66.89,100.8,85.35713,81.33807,71.12,125.1589,58.401,35.96591,51.8736,90.46085,265.146,99.86882}","topology_node_id":176463,"1":176463,"precomputed_age":87.200000000000003,"2":"87.2","precomputed_ci_low":81.338070000000002,"3":"81.33807","precomputed_ci_high":91,"4":"91","adjusted_age":0,"5":null,"ci_string":"CI: (81.33807 - 91)","6":"CI: (81.33807 - 91)","preadjusted_age":0}}
