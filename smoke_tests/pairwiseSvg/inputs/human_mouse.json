Recent fossil discoveries and molecular clock dating studies have suggested a divergence of bilaterian phyla &gt;100 million years before the Cambrian, when the first definite crown-bilaterian fossils occur. Most previous molecular clock dating studies, however, have suffered from limited data and biases in methodologies, and virtually all have failed to acknowledge the large uncertainties associated with the fossil record of early animals, leading to inconsistent estimates among studies. Here we use an unprecedented amount of molecular data, combined with four fossil calibration strategies (reflecting disparate and controversial interpretations of the metazoan fossil record) to obtain Bayesian estimates of metazoan divergence times. Our results indicate that the uncertain nature of ancient fossils and violations of the molecular clock impose a limit on the precision that can be achieved in estimates of ancient molecular timescales. For example, although we can assert that crown Metazoa originated during the Cryogenian (with most crown-bilaterian phyla diversifying during the Ediacaran), it is not possible with current data to pinpoint the divergence events with sufficient accuracy to test for correlations between geological and biological events in the history of animals. Although a Cryogenian origin of crown Metazoa agrees with current geological interpretations, the divergence dates of the bilaterians remain controversial.

Here we present a comprehensive mitogenomic study of primates. We assembled 87 mammalian mitochondrial genomes, including 62 primate species representing all the families of the order. We newly sequenced eleven mitochondrial genomes, including eight Old World monkeys and three strepsirrhines. Phylogenetic analyses support a strong topology, confirming the monophyly for all the major primate clades. In contrast to previous mitogenomic studies, the positions of tarsiers and colugos relative to strepsirrhines and anthropoids are well resolved. In order to improve our understanding of how fossil calibrations affect age estimates within primates, we explore the effect of seventeen fossil calibrations across primates and other mammalian groups and we select a subset of calibrations to date our mitogenomic tree. The divergence date estimates of the Strepsirrhine\/Haplorhine split support an origin of crown primates in the Late Cretaceous, at around 74Ma.

Most of what we know about the higher-level relationships among fish lineages has been based on morphology, but rapid influx of molecular studies is changing many established systematic concepts. We report a comprehensive molecular phylogeny for bony fishes that includes representatives of all major lineages. DNA sequence data for 21 molecular markers (one mitochondrial and 20 nuclear genes) were collected for 1410 bony fish taxa, plus four tetrapod species and two chondrichthyan outgroups (total 1416 terminals). Bony fish diversity is represented by 1093 genera, 369 families, and all traditionally recognized orders. The maximum likelihood tree provides unprecedented resolution and high bootstrap support for most backbone nodes, defining for the first time a global phylogeny of fishes. The general structure of the tree is in agreement with expectations from previous morphological and molecular studies, but significant new clades arise.

Among mammals, bats possess unique traits that place unusual demands on their vestibular systems. First, bats are capable of powered flight, which in birds is associated with enlarged semicircular canals. Second, many bats have enlarged cochleae associated with echolocation, and both cochleae and semicircular canals share a space within the petrosal bone. To determine how bat vestibular systems have evolved in the face of these pressures, we used micro-CT scans to compare canal morphology across species with contrasting flight and echolocation capabilities. We found no increase in canal radius in bats associated with the acquisition of powered flight, but canal radius did correlate with body mass in bat species from the suborder Yangochiroptera, and also in non-echolocating Old World fruit bats from the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. No such trend was seen in members of the Yinpterochiroptera that use laryngeal echolocation, although canal radius was associated with wing-tip roundedness in this group. We also found that the vestibular system scaled with cochlea size, although the relationship differed in species that use constant frequency echolocation. Across all bats, the shape of the anterior and lateral canals was associated with large cochlea size and small body size respectively, suggesting differential spatial constraints on each canal depending on its orientation within the skull. Thus in many echolocating bats, it seems that the combination of small body size and enlarged cochlea together act as a principal force on the vestibular system. The two main groups of echolocating bats displayed different canal morphologies, in terms of size and shape in relation to body mass and cochlear size, thus suggesting independent evolutionary pathways and offering tentative support for multiple acquisitions of echolocation.","author":"Davies","title":"The evolution of bat vestibular systems in the face of potential antagonistic selection pressures for flight and echolocation.","year":2013,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"mus musculus","link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9606|human&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=10090|mus musculus&lvl=0&srchmode=1","time":85.36},{"citation_num":3010,"pubmed_id":23533597,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the circular DNA molecule inside the mitochondria of all eukaryotic cells, has been shown to be under the effect of purifying selection in several species.

We also compare the forage selection of extant species, which offers an insight into their future prospects. The earliest lagomorphs originated in Asia and later diversified in different continents. Within ochotonids, more than 20 genera occupied the period from the early Miocene to middle Miocene, whereas most of them became extinct during the transition from the Miocene to Pliocene. The peak diversity of the leporids occurred during the Miocene to Pliocene transition, while their diversity dramatically decreased in the late Quaternary. Mantel tests identified a positive correlation between body length and phylogenetic distance of lagomorphs. The body length of extant ochotonids shows a normal distribution, while the body length of extant leporids displays a non-normal pattern. We also find that the forage selection of extant pikas features a strong preference for C(3) plants, while for the diet of leporids, more than 16% of plant species are identified as C(4) (31% species are from Poaceae). The ability of several leporid species to consume C(4) plants is likely to result in their size increase and range expansion, most notably in Lepus. Expansion of C(4) plants in the late Miocene, the so-called 'nature's green revolution', induced by global environmental change, is suggested to be one of the major 'ecological opportunities', which probably drove large-scale extinction and range contraction of ochotonids, but inversely promoted diversification and range expansion of leporids.","author":"Ge","title":"Evolutionary history of lagomorphs in response to global environmental change.","year":2013,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"mus musculus","link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9606|human&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=10090|mus musculus&lvl=0&srchmode=1","time":79.89},{"citation_num":2407,"pubmed_id":22536316,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Our large brain, long life span and high fertility are key elements of human evolutionary success and are often thought to have evolved in interplay with tool use, carnivory and hunting.

In a model encompassing a total of 67 species and genera from 12 mammalian orders, adult brain mass and two dichotomous variables reflecting species differences regarding limb biomechanics and dietary profile, accounted for 75.5%, 10.3% and 3.4% of variance in time to weaning, respectively, together capturing 89.2% of total variance. Crucially, carnivory predicted the time point of early weaning in humans with remarkable precision, yielding a prediction error of less than 5% with a sample of forty-six human natural fertility societies as reference. Hence, carnivory appears to provide both a necessary and sufficient explanation as to why humans wean so much earlier than the great apes. While early weaning is regarded as essentially differentiating the genus Homo from the great apes, its timing seems to be determined by the same limited set of factors in humans as in mammals in general, despite some 90 million years of evolution. Our analysis emphasizes the high degree of similarity of relative time scales in mammalian development and life history across 67 genera from 12 mammalian orders and shows that the impact of carnivory on time to weaning in humans is quantifiable, and critical.

We obtained sequence data from 25 nuclear loci (~500-1,000 bp per gene; 19,020bp total) for 64 squamate species and nine outgroup taxa, estimated the phylogeny, and estimated divergence dates using 14 fossil calibrations. We then evaluated how well each method approximated these dates using random subsets of the nuclear loci (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20; replicated 10 times each), and using ~1 kb of the mitochondrial ND2 gene. We find that estimates from r8s-PL based on 2, 5, or 10 loci can differ considerably from those based on 25 loci (mean absolute value of differences between 2-locus and 25-locus estimates were 9.0 Myr). Estimates from BEAST are somewhat more consistent given limited sampling of loci (mean absolute value of differences between 2 and 25-locus estimates were 5.0 Myr). Most strikingly, age estimates using r8s-PL for ND2 were ~68-82 Myr older (mean=73.1) than those using 25 nuclear loci with r8s-PL. These results show that dates from r8s-PL with a limited number of loci (and especially mitochondrial data) can differ considerably from estimates derived from a large number of nuclear loci, whereas estimates from BEAST derived from fewer nuclear loci or mitochondrial data alone can be surprisingly similar to those from many nuclear loci. However, estimates from BEAST using relatively few loci and mitochondrial data could still show substantial deviations from the full data set (>50 Myr), suggesting the benefits of sampling many nuclear loci. Finally, we found that confidence intervals on ages from BEAST were not significantly different when sampling 2 vs. 25 loci, suggesting that adding loci decreased errors but did not increase confidence in those estimates.","author":"Mulcahy","title":"Estimating divergence dates and evaluating dating methods using phylogenomic and mitochondrial data in squamate reptiles.","year":2012,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"mus musculus","link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9606|human&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=10090|mus musculus&lvl=0&srchmode=1","time":97.88},{"citation_num":3055,"pubmed_id":23071573,"ref_id":null,"abst":"The timing of the origin and diversification of rodents remains controversial, due to conflicting results from molecular clocks and paleontological data.

In contrast, most molecular studies place the origin and initial diversification of crown-Rodentia deep in the Cretaceous, although some molecular analyses have recovered estimated divergence times that are more compatible with the fossil record. Here we attempt to resolve this conflict by carrying out a molecular clock investigation based on a nine-gene sequence dataset and a novel set of seven fossil constraints, including two new rodent records (the earliest known representatives of Cardiocraniinae and Dipodinae). Our results indicate that rodents originated around 61.7-62.4 Ma, shortly after the Cretaceous\/Paleogene (K\/Pg) boundary, and diversified at the intraordinal level around 57.7-58.9 Ma. These estimates are broadly consistent with the paleontological record, but challenge previous molecular studies that place the origin and early diversification of rodents in the Cretaceous. This study demonstrates that, with reliable fossil constraints, the incompatibility between paleontological and molecular estimates of rodent divergence times can be eliminated using currently available tools and genetic markers.

In these studies the relationships among some orders of the super-clade Laurasiatheria were poorly supported, albeit not studied in detail. Therefore, 4775 protein-coding genes (6,196,263 nucleotides) were collected and aligned in order to analyze the evolution of this clade.

RESULTS: We have sequenced and performed extensive evolutionary analyses on the mitochondrial genome of the scaly-tailed flying squirrel Anomalurus sp., an enigmatic rodent whose phylogenetic affinities have been obscure and extensively debated. Our phylogenetic analyses of the coding regions of available complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Euarchontoglires suggest that Anomalurus is a sister taxon to the Hystricognathi, and that this clade represents the most basal divergence among sampled Rodentia. Bayesian dating methods incorporating a relaxed molecular clock provide divergence-time estimates which are consistently in agreement with the fossil record and which indicate a rapid radiation within Glires around 60 million years ago.

According to these data, Laonastes and Diatomyidae are the sister clade of extant Ctenodactylidae (i.e., gundies) and do not belong to the Hystricognathi. To solve the phylogenetic position of Laonastes, we conducted a large-scale molecular phylogeny of rodents. The analysis includes representatives of all major rodent taxonomic groups and was based on 5.5 kb of sequence data from four nuclear and two mitochondrial genes. To further validate the obtained results, a short interspersed element insertion analysis including 11 informative loci was also performed. Our molecular data based on sequence and short interspersed element analyses unambiguously placed Laonastes as a sister clade of gundies. All alternative hypotheses were significantly rejected based on Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests, supporting the idea that Laonastes does not belong to the Hystricognathi. Molecular dating analysis also supports an ancient divergence, approximately 44 Mya ago, between Ctenodactylidae and Laonastes.

Although most mitochondrial (mt) analyses have suggested that rodents have a basal position in the eutherian tree, some nuclear data in combination with mt-rRNA genes have placed the root on the so-called African clade or on a branch that includes this clade and the Xenarthra (e.g., anteater and armadillo).

Tribospheny allows for both shearing and grinding occlusal functions. Marsupials and placentals are advanced tribosphenic mammals (i.e., Theria) that show additional modifications of the tribosphenic dentition including loss of the distal metacristid and development of double-rank postvallum\/prevallid shear. The recent discovery of Eomaia [Nature 416 (2002) 816], regarded as the oldest eutherian mammal, implies that the marsupial-placental split is at least 125 million years old. The conventional scenario for the evolution of tribosphenic and therian mammals hypothesizes that each group evolved once, in the northern hemisphere, and is based on a predominantly Laurasian fossil record. With the recent discovery of the oldest tribosphenic mammal (Ambondro) from the Mesozoic of Gondwana, Flynn et al. [Nature 401 (1999) 57] suggested that tribospheny evolved in Gondwana rather than in Laurasia. Luo et al. [Nature 409 (2001) 53; Acta Palaeontol.

Here, we present cladistic evidence for a single origin of tribosphenic molars. Further, Ambondro may be a stem eutherian, making the split between marsupials and placentals at least 167 m.y. old.

We propose an integrated genomic, paleontological, and biogeographic hypothesis to account for these earliest splits on the placental mammal family tree and address current discrepancies between fossil and molecular evidence.","author":"Eizirik","title":"Molecular dating and biogeography of the early placental mammal radiation.","year":2001,"taxon_a":"human","taxon_b":"mus musculus","link_taxon_a":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=9606|human&lvl=0&srchmode=1","link_taxon_b":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Taxonomy\/Browser\/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Undef&name=10090|mus musculus&lvl=0&srchmode=1","time":69},{"citation_num":511,"pubmed_id":8622763,"ref_id":"Hedges1996a","abst":"To increase knowledge about the systematics and evolution of Mediterranean soles, we assessed mitochondrial DNA variation, molecular phylogeny, and evolution in eight species from the genera Solen, Microchirus, Monochirus, and Buglossidium by large ribosomal subunit (16S) and cytochrome b (cytb) sequence analysis. Relevant molecular features are the great variation of base composition among species at the third codon in cytb and the heterogeneity of the nucleotide substitution rate. Phylogenies recovered using 16S nucleotide and cytb amino acid sequences agree with those based on morphology in assessing monophyly of Solea species and ancestry of Buglossidium luteum, but they are against the intergeneric differentiation of Microchirus and Monochirus. Conversely, phylogenetic trees based on cytb nucleotide sequences yielded relationships among taxa regardless of their evolutionary histories.

Events of substitution rate change are placed onto a phylogenetic tree according to a Poisson process. When an event of substitution rate change occurs, the current rate of substitution is modified by a gamma-distributed random variable. Parameters of the model can be estimated using Bayesian inference. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo integration to evaluate the posterior probability distribution because the posterior probability involves high dimensional integrals and summations. Specifically, we use the Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm with 11 different move types to evaluate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the method by analyzing a complete mtDNA sequence data set from 23 mammals. The model presented here has several potential advantages over other models that have been proposed to relax the clock because it is parametric and does not assume that rates change only at speciation events.

In the present study a new framework is developed for the phylogenetic analysis of bilaterian relationships, using concatenated amino acid sequences of several nuclear genes. In this analysis, the rhabditophoran platyhelminths are probably the sister group of all other analyzed Bilateria, the Eubilateria, which are characterized by a one-way intestine with an anus. The Eubilateria are split into the nematode lineage and the coelomates. The phylogenetic results of the present study indicate that genetic features found in the model organisms Caenorhabditis and Drosophila might be found in all Eubilateria.

The new sequence data obtained here for mouse RH50 and RH30 and for macaque RH50 allowed us to compare the evolutionary rates of the two genes and to show that RH50 evolved about 2.6 times more slowly than RH30 at nonsynonymous positions. This result implies that Rh50 proteins were evolutionarily more conserved compared to Rh30 polypeptides, thus being indicative of the functional significance of the former protein in species as distantly related as sponge and human. The duplication event leading to RH50 and RH30 genes was estimated to have occurred between 250 and 346 million years ago. Moreover, we could also estimate that the duplication event producing the RHCE and RHD genes occurred some 8.5 +\/- 3.4 million years ago, in the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla.

Many parts of the trees we obtain agree with those on published protein ML trees. Interesting results include a preference for rodent monophyly. The detection of a few alternative signals to those on the optimal tree were obtained using the distance Hadamard transform (with results expressed as a Lento plot). One rearrangement suggested was the interchange of the position of primates and rodents on the optimal tree. The basic stability of the tree, combined with two calibration points (whale\/cow and horse\/rhinoceros), together with a distant secondary calibration from the mammal\/bird divergence, allows inferences of the times of divergence of putative clades. Allowing for sampling variances due to finite sequence length, most major divergences amongst lineages leading to modern orders, appear to occur well before the Cretaceous\/Tertiary (K\/T) boundary.

The analysis rejected significantly the commonly acknowledged Theria hypothesis, according to which Marsupialia and Eutheria are grouped together to the exclusion of Monotremata.

An alternative tRNA-Lys gene was not identified in any other region of the mtDNA of the wallaroo, suggesting that a tRNA-Lys of nuclear origin is imported into marsupial mitochondria. Previously described RNA editing of tRNA-Asp and rearrangement of some tRNA genes were reconfirmed in the mtDNA of the wallaroo. The divergence between Monotremata\/Marsupialia and Eutheria was timed to approximately 130 million years before present (MYBP). The same calculations suggested that Monotremata and Marsupialia diverged approximately 115 MYBP and that Australian and American marsupials separated approximately 75 MYBP.
