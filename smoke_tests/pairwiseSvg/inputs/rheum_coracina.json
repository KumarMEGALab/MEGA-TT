However, the composition of modern-day genomes may bear imprints of ancient biogeochemical events. Here we use an explicit model of macroevolution including gene birth, transfer, duplication and loss events to map the evolutionary history of 3,983 gene families across the three domains of life onto a geological timeline. Surprisingly, we find that a brief period of genetic innovation during the Archaean eon, which coincides with a rapid diversification of bacterial lineages, gave rise to 27% of major modern gene families. A functional analysis of genes born during this Archaean expansion reveals that they are likely to be involved in electron-transport and respiratory pathways. Genes arising after this expansion show increasing use of molecular oxygen (P = 3.4 \u00d7 10(-8)) and redox-sensitive transition metals and compounds, which is consistent with an increasingly oxygenating biosphere.","author":"David","title":"Rapid evolutionary innovation during an Archaean genetic expansion.","year":2011,"taxon_a":"Rheum","taxon_b":"Coracina","time":1416.1700000000001,"tree_count":1,"css_class":"new_study"},{"citation_num":1942,"pubmed_id":null,"ref_id":"Berbee2010a","abst":"Integration of fungal evolution with the dates of plate tectonic movements, paleoecology, and the evolution of plants and animals requires a molecularclock. Imperfect though they may be, molecularclocks provide the means to convert molecular change into geological time. The relationships among clocks, phylogeography, fossils, and substitution rate variation, along with incorporation of uncertainty into clock estimates are the topics for this commentary. This commentary is timely because, for deeper divergences on the order of hundreds of millions of years, estimates of age of origin are benefiting from increasingly accurate organismal phylogenies and increasingly realistic models of molecular evolution. Taking advantage of Bayesian approaches permitting complex assumptions about node ages and molecular evolution, we used the program BEAST to apply a relaxed lognormal clock analysis to a data set comprising 50 loci for 26 taxa. In the resulting tree, branches associated with nodes calibrated by fossils showed more dramatic substitution rate variation than branches at nodes lacking calibration. As a logical extension of this result, we suspect that undetected rate variation in the uncalibrated parts of the tree is as dramatic as in the calibrated sections, underscoring the importance of fossil calibration. Fortunately, new and interesting fungal fossils are being discovered and we review some of the new discoveries that confirm the ancient origin of important taxa. To help evaluate which fossils might be useful for constraining the ages of nodes, we selected fossils thought to be early members of their clades and used ribosomal or protein-coding gene sequence substitution rates to calculate whether fossil age and expected lineage age coincide. Where ages of a fossil and the expected age of a lineage do coincide, the fossils will be particularly useful in constraining node ages in molecularclock analyses.","author":"Berbee","title":"Dating the molecular clock in fungi  how close are we?","year":2010,"taxon_a":"Rheum","taxon_b":"Coracina","time":1212.71,"tree_count":1,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":480,"pubmed_id":10097391,"ref_id":"Wang1999a","abst":"In the past, molecular clocks have been used to estimate divergence times among animal phyla, but those time estimates have varied widely (1200-670 million years ago, Ma). In order to obtain time estimates that are more robust, we have analysed a larger number of genes for divergences among three well-represented animal phyla, and among plants, animals and fungi. The time estimate for the chordate-arthropod divergence, using 50 genes, is 993 ,\/- 46 Ma. Nematodes were found to have diverged from the lineage leading to arthropods and chordates at 1177 ,\/- 79 Ma. Phylogenetic analyses also show that a basal position of nematodes has strong support (p > 99%) and is not the result of rate biases. The three-way split (relationships unresolved) of plants, animals and fungi was estimated at 1576 ,\/- 88 Ma. By inference, the basal animal phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora) diverged between about 1200-1500 Ma.

However, molecular data analyses over the past 3 decades have found deeper divergences among animals (approximately 800 to 1,200 MYA), with and without the assumption of a global molecular clock. Recently, two studies have instead reported time estimates apparently consistent with the fossil record. Here, we demonstrate that methodological problems in these studies cast doubt on the accuracy and interpretations of the results obtained. In the study by Peterson et al., young time estimates were obtained because fossil calibrations were used as maximum limits rather than as minimum limits, and not because invertebrate calibrations were used. In the study by Aris-Brosou and Yang, young time estimates were obtained because of problems with rate models and other methods specific to the study, and not because Bayesian methods were used. This also led to many anomalous findings in their study, including a primate-rodent divergence at 320 MYA.

However, it can be shown that this estimate generally has an upward bias, and that an unbiased estimate is obtained by using distances based on concatenated sequences. We have shown that two concatenation-based distances, i.e., average gamma distance weighted with sequence length (d(2)) and multiprotein gamma distance (d(3)), generally give more satisfactory results than other concatenation-based distances. Using these two distance measures for 104 protein sequences, we estimated the time of divergence between mice and rats to be approximately 33 million years ago. Similarly, the time of divergence between humans and rodents was estimated to be approximately 96 million years ago. We also investigated the dependency of time estimates on statistical methods and various assumptions made by using sequence data from eubacteria, protists, plants, fungi, and animals. Our best estimates of the times of divergence between eubacteria and eukaryotes, between protists and other eukaryotes, and between plants, fungi, and animals were 3, 1.7, and 1.3 billion years ago, respectively.

In this context the relationships of the platyhelminths and the nematodes play a crucial role. Previous molecular studies of the relationships of these groups, which were based on 18S ribosomal DNA sequences, yielded conflicting results. In the present study a new framework is developed for the phylogenetic analysis of bilaterian relationships, using concatenated amino acid sequences of several nuclear genes. In this analysis, the rhabditophoran platyhelminths are probably the sister group of all other analyzed Bilateria, the Eubilateria, which are characterized by a one-way intestine with an anus. The Eubilateria are split into the nematode lineage and the coelomates. The phylogenetic results of the present study indicate that genetic features found in the model organisms Caenorhabditis and Drosophila might be found in all Eubilateria.

Beyond that, the availability of complete genome sequences for several eubacteria and an archaebacterium has had a great impact on the interpretation of certain aspects of the data. Thus, the majority of the archaebacterial sequences are not consistent with currently accepted views of the Tree of Life which cluster the archaebacteria with eukaryotes. Instead, they are either outliers or mixed in with eubacterial orthologs. The simplest resolution of the problem is to postulate that many of these sequences were carried into eukaryotes by early eubacterial endosymbionts about 2 billion years ago, only very shortly after or even coincident with the divergence of eukaryotes and archaebacteria. The strong resemblances of these same enzymes among the major eubacterial groups suggest that the cyanobacteria and Gram-positive and Gram-negative eubacteria also diverged at about this same time, whereas the much greater differences between archaebacterial and eubacterial sequences indicate these two groups may have diverged between 3 and 4 billion years ago.","author":"Feng","title":"Determining divergence times with a protein clock: update and reevaluation.","year":1997,"taxon_a":"Rheum","taxon_b":"Coracina","time":1215,"tree_count":4,"css_class":""},{"citation_num":418,"pubmed_id":9211740,"ref_id":null,"abst":"Previously we suggested that four proteins including aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) evolved with approximately constant rates over long periods covering the whole animal phyla. The constant rates of aldolase and TPI evolution were reexamined based on three different models for estimating evolutionary distances. It was shown that the evolutionary rates remain essentially unchanged in comparisons not only between different classes of vertebrates but also between vertebrates and arthropods and even between animals and plants, irrespective of the models used. Thus these enzymes might be useful molecular clocks for inferring divergence times of animal phyla. To know the divergence time of Parazoa and Eumetazoa and that of Cephalochordata and Vertebrata, the aldolase cDNAs from Ephydatia fluviatilis, a freshwater sponge, and the TPI cDNAs from Ephydatia fluviatilis and Branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, have been cloned and sequenced. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of aldolase and TPI from the freshwater sponge with known sequences revealed that the Parazoa-Eumetazoa split occurred about 940 million years ago (Ma) as determined by the average of two proteins and three models.
